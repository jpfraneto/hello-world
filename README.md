# hello-world
I want to be the best coder I can, and reading up the docummentation for understanding the underlying aspects of the platforms and systems I'm using is a way of working that makes sense to me. 

Why I have been learning how to code? 

It all started with the pandemic. Before all this happened my relationship with computers and the internet was kind of distant; I didn't like what technology was bringing to our speciies. I saw people deep into their phones, and not understanding what was happening around them, and my reaction to this was to say: OK, I don't want technology in my life. But when the pandemic started, I began to participate in different instances where I would relate to people from all over the world through zoom, and with this realized that I had to evolve my mindset. There was an open ocean of opportunities here, and I decided to jump right in. I started learning Python, but after a while I realized that I wanted to build stuff with which other people could relate to. I wanted to build things with which users would spend time with. And this is when I discovered web development, and started learning as much as I could about it. Since then I have been commited to the learning process, practicing every day. Training every day. And here I am, ready to understand how to make a proper use of Github so that I can start connecting with the ecosystem that surrounds all this amazing world.
